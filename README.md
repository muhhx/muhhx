# Murilo Santos

Full-stack engineer with a background in architecture and design (I love everything that has to do with visual design, from branding to typography). I've been developing digital products and websites for national as well as worldwide companies for three years.
 
Fun fact: I played semi-professional soccer here in Brazil, traveling and playing in tournaments througout the country. I was a left-back in the Coritiba Football Club youth academy, and almost went to a US university to play soccer with a scholarship.
