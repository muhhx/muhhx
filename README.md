# Murilo Santos

Full stack engineer with a strong background in design. I've been developing websites and systems for national, as well as wordwide companies for the past 3 years, aways with a peculiar attention to User Experience.
 
Fun fact: I played semi-professional soccer here in Brazil, traveling and playing in tournaments throughout the country. I was a left-back in the Coritiba Football Club youth academy, and almost went to an US university to play soccer with a full scholarship.
