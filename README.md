# Murilo Santos

Full-stack engineer with a background in architecture and design. I've been developing digital products and websites for national as well as worldwide companies for two years.

I love everything that has to do with visual design, from branding to typography. Besides that, I also enjoy a good cup of coffee, some jazz, competitive programming, and playing any sport you can imagine (I've done everything from swimming to jiu jitsu, also played semi-professional soccer here in Brazil).
