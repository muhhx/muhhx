# Murilo Santos

Full-stack engineer with a background in architecture and design (I love everything that has to do with visual design, from branding to typography.) I've been developing digital products and websites for national as well as worldwide companies for two years.
 
Fun fact: Throught my life, I've done every type of sports you can imagine, from swimming to jiu jitsu, also played semi-professional soccer here in Brazil.
