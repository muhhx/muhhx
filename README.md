Always looking to be better than the day before, have continuous growth and impact people's lives

I work using technologies like <strong>React and TypeScript</strong> and I'm looking forward to new experiences with them.

I chose development because it's amazing, the amount of things that can be created and the impact it can have on people's lives makes me excited.
